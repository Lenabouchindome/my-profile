		<h2> About me : </h2>

		<p>Hello, my name is <strong> L√©na Bouchindome </strong>, I am 18 years old and I live in St nom la breteche. I study at the <strong> EMLV</strong>, a business school  üéì.

			<h2> Why am I dynamic ü§™ ? </h2>
			<p> 
			I am a quick-witted, energetic and active person. I think about a lot of things very quickly in my head. This can create a problem with others because they sometimes can't keep up with me. I do yoga and meditation to calm myself.
			</p>

			<h2> Why am I sociable ü•∞ ? </h2>
			<p>
			I like to know that I am surrounded by good people, it makes me feel better. I have no problem going out and talking to people. I also like to be alone from time to time because I think it is important to learn to be alone from time to time.
			</p>

			<h2> Why am I happy ‚òÄÔ∏è ? </h2>
			<p>
			To tell the truth I am not happy all the time, I am a human being. But a small thing or a simple thing will make me happy. I am happy with what I have in my life and I try to be as positive as possible.

			<h2> Why did I choose emlv ? üéì</h2>
			<p>
				Before, I wanted to study perfumery but I decided to go to a business school for different reasons. I passed the sesame exam and I chose the EMLV for the transversality, the good grades on the internet, the internships, the possibility of alternating courses and the English curriculum in the 4th year, the 3rd year abroad.
